Hey there! I'm Anthony Eden, the creator and founder of [DNSimple](https://dnsimple.com). I've been developing web applications since the early days of the web (1995). I develop in Ruby, Erlang and Golang as well as other languages.

You can find me on Twitter as [@aeden](http://twitter.com/aeden) and on Github as [aeden](https://github.com/aeden) as well. I have created a large number of open source projects, some of which I continue to maintain today.

I also publish a podcast called the [Strong Businesses Podcast](http://www.strongbusinessespodcast.com) with Steven Bristol of LessEverything.
