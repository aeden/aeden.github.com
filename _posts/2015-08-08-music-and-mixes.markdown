It's been quite some time since I've published here, but I wanted to share some things I've been working on lately.

First, I'm publishing a progressive house and trance podcast, usually each week. You can subscribe using this URL: [http://anthonyeden.com/progressive/podcast.xml](http://anthonyeden.com/progressive/podcast.xml) or head over to the [Progessive Podcast page](/progressive/) I set up with track listings for each mix.. Each week I find my favorite progressive house and trance tracks, along with occasional other EDM styles, and I put them in a continous mix. I hope you enjoy!

I've also begun exprimenting with my own compositions again. I'll publish them up on [my SoundCloud page](https://soundcloud.com/aeden-1).

Over at DNSimple we've been hard at work making new things and improving DNSimple for everyone. Some examples of things that we've recently released:

* [How DNS Works](http://howdns.works) - a web comic explaining how DNS works.
* [Zone Vision](http://zone.vision) - a tool for DNS zone diagnostics.
* [DNSimple Blog](http://blog.dnsimple.com) - we've been publishing lots of blog posts about us and our customers.

That's the update for now. Thanks for dropping by!
