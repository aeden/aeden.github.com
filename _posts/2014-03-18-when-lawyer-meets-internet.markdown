## So what is this BDFP Legal entity?

This email came from noreply@bdfp-legal.com, which is the first strike against them.

Their web site seems to indicate they are a law firm, however there is no way to contact them. I also took a look at their whois information but it doesn't tell me much since they've placed whois privacy on it.

So I can't reply, I can't unsubscribe, or otherwise remove myself from their database, my name is part of the email address, so clearly it is personally identifiable data, and basically I'm just supposed to archive the message and move on.

But at least they've taken the space in their footer to tell me I cannot distribute or copy this information...oops, looks like I just did that. I'll have you know that I "destroyed" the message by marking it as spam, so at least there's that.

The sad part is that I'm familiar with The Data Insititute as they are a fairly well-known brand. I hope that they consider the impact of what their partners do and set policies that avoid these types of emails going out in the future.
